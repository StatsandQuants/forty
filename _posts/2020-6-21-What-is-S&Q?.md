I know: the title is not so interesting. Even not so funny. Because... the intentions are serious here: understanding complex phenomena, providing data analysis and quantitative/logical/statistical considerations.

Why? Firstly, I truly like it, and I do it on a daily basis. Secondly, I would like to talk about all-round complexity.

(Another) Why? Well-being is possible in an intelligent-enough environment. All the human problems need to be analyzed in detail, from different perspectives, in order to take better decisions. If we agree that well-being mostly derives from our individual and collective choices... well, let's get started!

Disclaimer: I don't give answers. I make some questions. I show some data. I express my opinion. I make jokes. Hope you guys have some material to think about...
